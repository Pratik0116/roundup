Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces.  It is based on the winning
design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design
competition.

The current stable version of Roundup is 2.1.0. It is a bug fix
and minor feature release for the major 2.0.0 release which
added:

   * Python 2 and Python 3 support
   * a new REST interface
   * updates to jinja2 templates including security improvements

Fixes and features in the 2.1.0 release include:

   * Installation uses setuptools and not distutils.
   * Mysql backend now uses an index to make sure that key values are
     not duplicated when two roundup processes run in parallel.
   * Postgres back end now uses a server side cursor, so large queries
     won't consume huge amounts of memory.
   * Security fixes for jQuery, markdown handling,
   * Valid class names are documented and enforced. All class names now
     match ``[A-z][A-z0-9_]+[A-z_]``.
   * Fixes/improvements to jinja2 templates
   * Fixes for python3 compatibility.
   * Fix sorting of multilinks in templating code.
   * Password reset documented in user guide.

More info on the 58 changes can be found in the `change note`_.

For more information on Roundup see the :doc:`design overview
<docs/design>`, and all the other :doc:`documentation <docs>`. Roundup
has been deployed for:

    * bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic
      installation)
    * customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone
      answerers, linking to networking, system and development
      issue trackers)
    * issue management for IETF working groups
    * sales lead tracking
    * conference paper submission and double-blind referee
      management
    * weblogging (well, almost :) 

...and so on. It's been designed with :doc:`flexibility
<docs/customizing>` in mind - it's not just another bug
tracker. Roundup ships with a *demo tracker* to play with - after
you've unpacked the source, just run "python demo.py" and load up the
URL it prints out!

Roundup was originally released as version 0.1.1 in late August, 2001.
The first `change note`_ written said:

    Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many Perl-based systems, to no avail.
    Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be released. Had just finished major product project, so needed
    something different for a while. Roundup here I come...
