Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces.  It is based on the winning
design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design
competition.

The current stable version of Roundup is 2.0.0 which has quite a
comprehensive :doc:`feature set <docs/features>` compared to the last
stable release (v1.6.1). These features include:

   * Python 2 and Python 3 support
   * a new REST interface
   * updates to jinja2 templates including security improvements

The current latest release is 2.1.0beta1.

For more information see the :doc:`design overview <docs/design>`, and
all the other :doc:`documentation <docs>`. Roundup has been deployed
for:

    * bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic installation)
    * customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone answerers, linking to networking, 
      system and development issue trackers)
    * issue management for IETF working groups
    * sales lead tracking
    * conference paper submission and double-blind referee management
    * weblogging (well, almost :) 

...and so on. It's been designed with :doc:`flexibility
<docs/customizing>` in mind - it's not just another bug
tracker. Roundup ships with a *demo tracker* to play with - after
you've unpacked the source, just run "python demo.py" and load up the
URL it prints out!

Roundup was originally released as version 0.1.1 in late August, 2001. The first `change note`_ I wrote says:

    Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many Perl-based systems, to no avail.
    Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be released. Had just finished major product project, so needed
    something different for a while. Roundup here I come...
