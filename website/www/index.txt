Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web, REST, XML-RPC and e-mail interfaces.  It is based
on the winning design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry
"Track" design competition.

The current stable version of Roundup is 2.2.0. It is a bug fix
and feature release for the 2.1.0 release 

Release Highlights
==================

Some improvements from the 2.1.0 release are:

* Roundup supports dynamic and static compression of http
  responses. This improves performance when a front end web
  server isn't serving compressed assets.

* REST interface: supports CORS allowing Roundup to be
  used by third party web sites. Origins allowed to use
  REST can be specified. OpenAPI (Swagger) docs can be
  added. Error handling/reporting improved.

* Dockerfile support. Docker-compose for a mysql based
  tracker.

* New full text search methods. SQLite FTS and PostgreSQL
  full text search are supported. These allow search
  expressions in addition to simple word based searches.

* Secret values in config.ini can be stored in external
  files. This allows config.ini to be stored in a VCS
  without exposing secrets.

* Translation object added to internal database handle. This
  allows auditors and extensions to provide efficient
  translations.

* MySQL database creation uses COLLATE utf8_general_ci

* Wsgi startup improvements (must be enabled by setting
  feature flag).

* Fix crash when importing legacy Roundup tracker with long
  integers.

* Fix issues with Roundup unable to find supporting files
  when installed via pip.

More info on the 57 changes can be found in the `change note`_.

Roundup Use Cases
=================

For more information on Roundup see the :doc:`features list
<docs/features>`, :doc:`design overview <docs/design>`, and all the
other :doc:`documentation <docs>`. Roundup has been deployed for:

* bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic
  installation)
* customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone
  answerers, linking to networking, system and development
  issue trackers)
* issue management for IETF working groups
* sales lead tracking
* conference paper submission and double-blind referee
  management
* weblogging (well, almost :) 

...and so on. It's been designed with :doc:`flexibility
<docs/customizing>` in mind - it's not just another bug
tracker.


Try It Out
==========

Roundup ships with a **demo tracker** to play with - you don't need to
install Roundup. After you've unpacked the source, just run "``python
demo.py``" and load up the URL it prints out!

To create a source directory and run the demo follow these simple
steps (change the ``-2.2.0`` version identifier to match your downloaded
file).

1. ``python -m pip download roundup``
2. ``tar -xzvf roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz``

   * if you don't have a tar command, ``python -c 'import tarfile, sys; tarfile.open(sys.argv[1]).extractall();' roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz`` can be used.

3. ``cd roundup-2.2.0``
4. ``python demo.py``
 
Origin Story
============
Roundup was originally released as version 0.1.1 in late August, 2001.
The first `change note`_ written said:

    Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many Perl-based systems, to no avail.
    Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be released. Had just finished major product project, so needed
    something different for a while. Roundup here I come...
