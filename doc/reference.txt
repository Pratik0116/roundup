Welcome
=======

This document used to be part of the `customization document`_.  The
customization document was getting large and unwieldy.  It was a
combination of examples and internal information that made finding
information difficult. We often had questions on the mailing list that
were well answered in the customization document, but finding the info
was difficult.

The documentation is slowly being reorganized using the `Diataxis
framework`_. Help with the reorganization is welcome.


This is the document you should look at for background on a tutorial
or how-to guide in the customization document.
